  "description": "I am a second year PhD Student at The Ohio State University, advised by Prof Srinivasan Parthasarathy adn Prof Kannan Athreya. My reseasrch interests include but are not limited to Mechanistic Interpretability, Model Compression and Out-Of-Distribution Detection. I specifically focus on Mechanistic Interpretability. I am highly troubles by the fact that the complex machine learning models that seem to be deployed in out day to day are an unexplained frontier. I work to resolve this deeply troubling fact about our world. My research , very broadly, seeks to solve the AI Allignment pproblem, essentially, I work to align AI models to work with human values. As this is an unexplored frontier, I would love to collaborate on a plethora of issues. Please don't hesitate to reach out to me, in case you want to collaborate or are generally looking to understand more about the field of Mechanistic Interpretability ",
